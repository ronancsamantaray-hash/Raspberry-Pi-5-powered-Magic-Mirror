# Raspberry-Pi-5-powered-Magic-Mirror
I want to create a magic mirror for my bathroom to provide nessecary information for the day, such as weather, calendar, etc. This will be a challenging hardware project, but a simple software project as I am planning to use the MagicMirror 2 open source software. I will use a relatively cheap monitor and cheap dielectric glass.
